      <p>
        If you are earning ₹40,000 per month in Delhi, you are in the
        lower-middle to middle-class bracket.
        The salary is survivable, but not luxurious.
      </p>

      <h2>Monthly Expense Breakdown (Reality)</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Rent (shared PG/1RK): ₹10,000 – ₹15,000</li>
        <li>Food & groceries: ₹6,000 – ₹8,000</li>
        <li>Transport: ₹2,000 – ₹3,000</li>
        <li>Phone + internet + subscriptions: ₹1,000</li>
        <li>Personal spending: ₹3,000 – ₹5,000</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Total monthly expense easily reaches ₹25,000 – ₹30,000.
        This leaves you with only ₹10,000 – ₹15,000 for savings.
      </p>
