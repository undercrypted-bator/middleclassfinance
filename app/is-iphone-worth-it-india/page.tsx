      <h1>Is iPhone Worth It in India?</h1>

      <p style={{ color: "#aaa" }}>
        Real money advice for real Indian salaries.
      </p>

      <p>
        Buying an iPhone in India is not a tech decision.
        It is a <strong>financial decision.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Most Indians don’t buy iPhones because they need it.
        They buy it because:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Status</li>
        <li>Social pressure</li>
        <li>Instagram influence</li>
        <li>Peer comparison</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Real Question</h2>

      <p>
        The real question is not:
        <em> “Can I afford an iPhone?”</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        The real question is:
        <strong> “Is this iPhone worth my life hours?”</strong>
      </p>

      <h2>iPhone Reality by Salary</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Salary ₹25k → Not worth it</li>
        <li>Salary ₹40k → Financial stress</li>
        <li>Salary ₹60k → Borderline</li>
        <li>Salary ₹1L+ → Comfortable</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Hidden Cost Nobody Talks About</h2>

      <p>
        iPhone is not just the phone:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Accessories</li>
        <li>AppleCare</li>
        <li>Repairs</li>
        <li>Upgrades every 2–3 years</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Over 3 years, a ₹70,000 iPhone easily becomes
        a ₹1,00,000 lifestyle decision.
      </p>

      <h2>Middle Class Rule</h2>

      <p>
        If a phone costs more than
        <strong> one month of your salary,</strong>
        it is emotionally driven, not financially smart.
      </p>

      <h2>Check Your iPhone Reality</h2>

      <p>
        Don’t guess. Convert price into life hours:
      </p>
