      <p style={{ color: "#aaa" }}>
        A practical financial tool for real Indian income.
      </p>

      <p>
        MiddleClassFinance is a simple personal finance platform
        built for people who live on fixed monthly salaries.
      </p>

      <p>
        It focuses on one core problem:
        most financial advice on the internet is either
        unrealistic, influencer-driven, or designed for
        high-income lifestyles.
      </p>

      <h2>Why MiddleClassFinance Exists</h2>

      <p>
        The average Indian middle-class person struggles with:

        <li>EMI pressure</li>
        <li>Low savings rate</li>
        <li>Confusion about lifestyle decisions</li>
        <li>Unrealistic social media standards</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        MiddleClassFinance was created to provide
        clear, honest and practical financial tools
        without exaggeration or fake motivation.
      </p>

        <li>Shows lifestyle and EMI stress</li>

        <li>Encourages realistic savings habits</li>

        The goal of MiddleClassFinance is not to make you rich.
        The goal is to make you financially stable,
        stress-free and aware of your real financial reality.
      </p>

        Financial peace matters more than financial hype.
