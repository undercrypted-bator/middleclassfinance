        Real money advice for real Indian salaries.
      </p>

      <p>
        FIRE means <strong>Financial Independence, Retire Early</strong>.
        The idea is simple: save and invest enough so that
        you no longer need to work for money.
      </p>

      <p>
        But for most Indians, the real question is:
        <strong> can middle class realistically achieve FIRE?</strong>
      </p>

      <h2>The Honest Answer</h2>

      <p>
        Yes, FIRE is possible for middle class Indians,
        but only with discipline, realistic expectations,
        and long-term consistency.
      </p>

      <p>
        FIRE in India is not about retiring at 30.
        It is about becoming financially stress-free by 45–50.
      </p>

      <h2>The FIRE Formula (Simple)</h2>

      <p>
        The basic FIRE rule:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Annual expenses × 25 = FIRE corpus</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Example:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Monthly expense: ₹40,000</li>
        <li>Annual expense: ₹4.8 lakh</li>
        <li>FIRE corpus: ₹1.2 crore</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why Most Indians Fail at FIRE</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Low savings rate</li>
        <li>High lifestyle inflation</li>
        <li>Too much EMI</li>
        <li>No long-term investing discipline</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Realistic FIRE Strategy for Middle Class</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Save at least 30% of income</li>
        <li>Keep EMI below 30%</li>
        <li>Invest monthly in equity</li>
        <li>Increase income every 2–3 years</li>
        <li>Avoid lifestyle upgrades</li>
      </ul>
